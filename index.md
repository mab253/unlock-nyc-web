questions: '<h1>Questions</h1><h2>Why should I report?</h2><p>When you use your voice
  to report where discrimination is happening, who’s doing it, and what it sounds
  like, you’re helping paint a clearer picture of discrimination – so that together
  we can better push back against it! With your help, we can hold landlords and brokers
  accountable for breaking the law and push for policies that make vouchers work.</p><h2>Do
  you have a list of apartments I can apply for?</h2><p>We’re not brokers! We offer
  tools and tips to support you throughout the apartment search process. Our goal
  here is to ensure every New Yorker can search for and find a home without facing
  discrimination due to their voucher.</p><h2>How do you keep my reports and information
  secure?</h2><p>We are an independent group that is not affiliated with any real
  estate management company, landlord, brokering agency, housing authority, or homeless
  shelter services. You can choose to report anonymously, and we will never share
  your personal information without your permission.</p><h2>Can a landlord retaliate
  against me for making a report?</h2><p>No! Here''s what the New York City Commission
  on Human Rights says about that: "It is against the Law for anyone [...] to retaliate
  against you because you [...] made a charge or filed a complaint of discrimination
  with the NYC Commission on Human Rights, your employer, or any other agency." You
  can read more <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page" title="NYCCHR">on
  the CCHR website</a>.</p><p>If you believe you''ve been discriminated against in
  your housing search – even if you''re not 100% sure that what happened is illegal
  –&nbsp;report it! Investigators who specialize in the NYC Human Rights Law can take
  a look.</p><h2>How is using Unlock NYC different from calling 311?</h2><p>When you
  report through Unlock NYC, your report can do more.</p><p>If you request a formal
  investigation and attach evidence, we can send it to the city on your behalf – just
  like if you called 311. We''ll help you build a full report, which may help investigators
  negotiate on your behalf. And, you can save your information with us so you don''t
  have to answer all the same questions every time you report.</p><p>In addition,
  your report will also help change the <em>system</em> by making data about voucher
  discrimination available to the community-based organizations and advocates who
  are leading the movement to end it. Our partners use our reports to understand patterns
  about voucher discrimination – who''s doing it, where it''s happening, what it sounds
  like – so they can focus their attention and resources where they''re most needed.</p>'

# It should be easier to find a home with your voucher.

**If you’ve been having a hard time finding a home with a voucher in New York City, it’s not your fault.** Vouchers are supposed to help tenants find a home in cities with limited affordable housing options – and guess what? They’re a totally legitimate way to pay your rent! The vast majority of landlords in NYC are [required by law](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/source-of-income.page#:\~:text=Discrimination%20based%20on%20lawful%20source%20of%20income%20is%20the%20illegal,other%20forms%20of%20public%20assistance.) to accept vouchers. And yet, landlords and brokers are turning down New Yorkers like you, every day.

You deserve to be treated equally during your search for housing, no matter your situation. Whether you’ve been living in a family shelter, staying with friends or relatives, or you’re looking to move from your current place, you have the right to a fair housing search. We’re making it easier by offering free and friendly tools you can use to record and report discrimination.
