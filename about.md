# We are here to make the apartment search process transparent, fair, and free from discrimination for all New Yorkers.

## Our Story

Our founding team met through [Blue Ridge Labs](https://labs.robinhood.org/ "Blue Ridge Labs") @ [Robin Hood](https://www.robinhood.org/ "Robin Hood"), a social impact incubator that brings together technologists, designers, and communities to address critical problems facing New Yorkers through new and untested solutions. During our research, we heard stories from dozens of New Yorkers who were repeatedly and unlawfully denied access to a home, simply because they received government assistance to pay for rent. Whether they were staying in a family shelter, living doubled-up with friends or relatives, or trying to leave a precarious living arrangement, they would call an apartment listing to schedule a viewing, and were met with the same range of responses, over and over again: “Sorry, the unit is no longer available,” “No vouchers,” “The landlord prefers a working professional,” or “We don’t take Section 8 here.”

Often hiding in plain sight, discrimination happens in a split second over the phone, and can be tough to recognize, let alone document. As a result, countless New Yorkers remain homeless or in unsafe housing situations for months, if not years, and those who discriminate routinely profit from breaking the law.

## Our Approach

At Unlock NYC, we work with New Yorkers impacted by housing discrimination to build technology that makes it easy to identify, record, and report unfair treatment. Our users can choose to send their report to a fair housing agency that will take legal action on their behalf, or to add their story to our growing body of data on housing discrimination in New York City. Armed with this knowledge, we collaborate with advocates, organizers, and public agencies to hold discriminators accountable and push for stronger fair housing policies. Our vision is a New York City where everyone can find a safe, healthy, and secure place to call home.

We couldn’t do this work without the many New Yorkers who’ve shared their stories and insights with us through interviews, surveys, participatory design sessions, and more. We’re committed to continue to co-design our tools with New Yorkers and grassroots advocates to ensure that everything we build is useful, relevant, and responds to the priorities of people most affected by housing injustice in our city.

## Our Day-to-Day Team

We’re a small and dedicated team that deeply believes in every human’s right to housing and in recognizing the long histories of race, class, and gender-based oppression that have created the housing crisis we face today. We operate through consensus and have a deep commitment to horizontal, distributed decision-making. Collectively, we hold experiences in participatory design, software engineering, political and tenant organizing, and direct experiences of housing discrimination and navigating the housing voucher system..

At Unlock NYC, we value lived experience as expertise. Our tools are at their best when the people who use them are involved in big decisions from the start. As close collaborators and advisors to the Unlock NYC team, Leadership Collective members help shape the direction of our organization, and make sure that the knowledge, ideas, and vision of New Yorkers directly impacted by housing discrimination are at the heart of our work. Each Leadership Collective member brings a unique perspective and a set of skills to help inform strategic decisions.

## Our Supporters + Collaborators

In a city with skyrocketing rents and insufficient affordable housing, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers have to rely on government assistance to secure a home, many of whom face long stays in homeless shelters while they search. At Unlock NYC, we know New York City’s housing crisis will not be solved through a single intervention - it will take a mass, people-powered movement to win transformative change. That’s why take our cues from New Yorkers directly impacted by homelessness and from member-led organizations that mobilize for power and transformative change towards the right to housing. We support the [**#HomelessCantStayHome**](https://www.homelesscantstayhome.org/) and VALUE in Housing campaigns, and look forward to continuing to build with our partners, collaborators, and allies in the future.
